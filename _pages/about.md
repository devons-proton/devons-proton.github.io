Hello! My name is Devon Shelton, and I am an engineering student at the University of Washington majoring in Material Science and Engineering (MSE), with a minor in Aerospace Engineering (AE).
I mainly focus on additive manufacturing applications in the aerospace industry, specifically unmanned aircraft and small space systems.

Outside of academics, I develop my small open project (OpenPlane) and am a member of a few competitive clubs. I also enjoy collecting older technical books and papers (digital bookcase coming eventually), hiking the PNW, vehicle detailing, and making espresso.

Thank you for reading!
